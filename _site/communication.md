# Send a complete, finished message right away.

* This allows the recipient to immediately understand what’s being asked without being interrupted multiple times.
* It also shows that you've prepared well and thought through your question.
* There's even a website dedicated to this principle: https://nohello.net/en/

# When you're writing a message, it's your responsibility to ensure the other person understands it properly.
* Prepare in advance, add structure, and be specific in your questions.
* Each message should cover just one topic - it makes it easier to respond and track answers.

# When possible, conduct discussions in chats or threads that include all relevant participants.

* That way, the conversation is searchable and can be referenced later.
* You might also get quicker feedback from others with more context (especially useful to include your manager).

# Reply promptly - even if it's just to acknowledge the message and say you’re working on a response.
* You can use emojis or agreed-upon short responses for this.

# Use scheduled (delayed) messages.
* If something isn’t urgent and you don’t want to interrupt your colleague right away, consider scheduling the message for a more appropriate time.
* Pro tip: Don’t use round times like 09:00 - try 09:24 instead if you want it to feel less like it was sent by a bot.

# Messaging is asynchronous by default.
* Don’t expect an immediate response.
* Some people or chats (like those for critical bugs) may have different expectations—talk about response time norms with your team.

# Avoid sudden “quick” 1:1 calls.
* Sometimes they’re necessary, but set clear team rules about when these are appropriate.
* Don’t write “Can I call you now?” - if a voice or video call is needed, it’s better to schedule it with a clear agenda so everyone can prepare. Even 15 minutes of prep is better than none.

# If someone is in a video call, step away if you're talking to someone nearby so as not to disturb them.

# Use status indicators to show when you're available or when you shouldn’t be disturbed.

# Summarize discussions and clearly document agreements.
* Overcommunication is better than miscommunication.
